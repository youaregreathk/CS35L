1. Create a file hw4.txt using emacs
2. Check out version 3.0 from my repositorty into "quote" by:
   git checkout -b quote

3. Appyling the 'quote-3.0-patch.txt' by running:
   patch -p1 < ./quote-3.0-patch.txt
   It shows the following message
   patching file src/cmp.c
   patching file src/diff.c
   patching file src/diff3.c
   patching file src/dir.c
   patching file src/sdiff.c
   patching file src/util.c

4and 5. Opening  the above 6 c files, and inside the files I used the command:
   C-x 4 a.
  to add each change log entry to the file 'ChangeLog'
   For each change log, I wrote "change all the ` to '"

6.Then, I committed my changes to the new branch by:
  git add .
  git commit -F ChangeLog

7.To generate the file formatted-patch.txt, I used the below command:
  git format-patch --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
  and I openedthe formatted-patch.txt,
  and it was empty, then I run:
  git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
  and the formatted-patch file is correct.

8.I checked out to version 3.0 by:
  git checkout -f v3.0
  then I checked out to the branch ‘partner’ by:
  git checkout -b partner
  Then I run the below run the command for pathcing:
  git am < ../formatted-patch.txt
  Then I used the folling command
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  All the command works great

9.By using the command: make distir
  Inside folder ‘diffutils’, there exist a folder ‘diffutils-3.0.1-00cc’. There is
  ‘ChangeLog’ file, and in the file,
  I saw commit message of the 6 files.

10.I downloaded xquartz, and then logged out my laptop
   and logged in running xquartz, and I typed in：
   ssh -X @lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
   and then
   cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
   export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
   gitk
   Then I got a git window, from there I found the newest merge
   not newer than 2015-01-25, and took a screenshot
